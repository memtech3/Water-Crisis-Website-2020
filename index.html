        <h3 style>Heavy Metal Water Crisies during the Turn of the Century</h3>
        <p>
          In the late 19th and early 20th century, there was an “epidemic” (Clay
          & Troesken, n.d.) of lead poisoning due to usage of lead plumbing
          combined with acidic water, causing harmful amounts of lead to leach
          into the water system. One specific instance of early 20th century
          lead poisoning was in Lowell, Michigan. In 1900, the average lead
          level in Lowell tap water was 169 times the current EPA guidelines for
          lead contamination (Troesken, n.d., 10). Although it is believed that
          the majority of the lead content came from lead service lines,
          industrial pollution of water sources almost certainly contributed to
          the unusually high levels of lead contamination (Troesken, n.d., 8).
          One of the reasons that the lead service lines leeched such high
          amounts of lead, compared to other lead based systems, was that the
          water source that Lowell had recently switched to was very acidic
          (Clay & Troesken, n.d.), causing the lead to be more soluble.
          Additionally, the lead pipes were relatively new, meaning that they
          lacked a protective layer of corrosion to prevent water from coming
          into direct contact with the lead (Troesken, n.d., 2). The health
          effects of the high lead levels in Lowell were severe and long
          lasting, often accompanied by poor diagnosis and treatment and, for
          those who survived, chronic physical and mental health issues.

        <h3 style>Flint Michigan Heavy Metal Water Crisis</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the popularity and longevity of lead plumbing, there have been
          several notable (and many more less publicized) instances of lead
          contamination in the 21st century. Of today’s water crisis, the Flint
          Water Crisis is probably the most popular and best documented, due to
          its popularity. The Flint Water Crisis was a 4 year long water crisis,
          during which primarily lead, but also other contaminants such as
          legionnaires disease, were prevalent in the Flint Water System due to
          poor management and not following industry standard water safety
          practices. The direct cause of the Flint Water Crisis was almost
          certainly poverty due to the GM downsizings in the 1980’s (click on
          the graph to the left), leading to a slow and painful economic decline
          in Flint, ending with the state of Michigan taking over Flint’s
          finances and making the decision to switch water sources. Had Flint
          been a prosperous city, the lead service pipes would have either been
          replaced or properly maintained and the city of Flint wouldn’t have
          been placed into the hands of a state appointed emergency manager, who
          lead the city so poorly. To conclude, the Flint Water Crisis was
          almost entirely due to poverty, as without poverty, Flint would not
          have had to switch its water source from the Detroit Water System to
          the Flint River.
